                I like reading. When I cannot play games or watch TV, I will usually read. It makes you forget about reality and you are immersed in the book. Books are also very portable and you do not have to carry a heavy laptop if you want to read on a trip. They are also not as expensive as laptops and TVs so they are ideal if you want to waste some time.
